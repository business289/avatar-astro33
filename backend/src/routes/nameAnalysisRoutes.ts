Use ONLY the numbers and planets given above — do not invent new ones. Write in a warm, insightful, cinematic tone, similar to: "Your current name resonates with Number 8 which is ruled by Saturn. However your Life Path Number is 3 ruled by Jupiter. This creates friction between communication and opportunity."

IMPORTANT: Phrase any effect of changing the name spelling as a possibility, not a guarantee — use language like "may support", "tends to align with", "can help". Never claim a guaranteed real-world outcome.
